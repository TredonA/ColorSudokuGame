# Color Sodoku

Thanks for playing Color Sudoku!

If you are not familiar with regular sudoku, please feel free to take a look at the Sudoku Puzzle Rules on Sudoku's official website (https://www.sudoku.ws/rules.htm).

There's three basic rules you should be aware of:

  1. Each row may contain every color exactly once

  2. Each column contain every color exactly once

  3. Each designated 3 by 3 sub region may contain every color exactly once. (To avoid confusion, each 3x3 region is differentiated with        either all white cells or all grey cells)

To change the color of a cell, locate the cells location and type it in to the boxes adjacent to Cell Row and Cell Column. Afterwords, select what color you would like to change the cell to. Once you are finished, click submit and the game will do the rest. If the input is invalid, the game will let you know. If you are done with the board, you will receive a prompt congratulating you. Click the Next Board button to advance to a slightly more difficult board. The farther you get, the harder the boards become.

Tip: There's no back button so be sure to take your time and consider all the possibilities =)

Have fun!
